# Building a simple Python application using ChatGPT.

Today I used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to write a very simple but useful computer application. The task would have taken me half an hour or so.
ChatGPT did the job in a few seconds, and the code it wrote was well-structured, readable and well commented.

Here you'll find a [record of my interaction](docs/experiment.md) with ChatGPT and the code that it generated.

To whet your appetite, here's a plot created by the application showing how rapidily 
the [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) project's stars and forks are growing on GitHub.
